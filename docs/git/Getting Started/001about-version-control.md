# 001 About Version Control

`What is a version control system?`
:   Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to any specific state later. While the examples in this book focus on source code management, version control can handle any file type—including binaries. [^1]

:   If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead. [^1]

For a long, long, long time. Forget it. I won't talk about it. It was a long time ago.

But if I don't say it, some people will say that my book is not rigorous, Then I will describe it briefly.
